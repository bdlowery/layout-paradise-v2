# Hello!

This was a project for [Perpetual Education's](https://perpetual.education) "Design For The Web" course.

# Goal

Given the same HTML as everyone else in the class, create a theme targeted at a specific industry.

## My Theme

I chose a "beach vacation" company.

* There's 2 different themes for 2 different audiences. 

* One is a family-friendly resort, the other is an adult-only resort.

* Click on the links in the header to switch between themes.
